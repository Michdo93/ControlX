## 🧬 The Origin Story

In a world overflowing with devices, APIs, and systems, chaos is the norm. But where others see entropy, **Professor Charles Xavier** sees **potential**—a network of minds and machines, harmonized under a single will.

Inspired by his extraordinary ability to **interface with consciousness**, ControlX was born. Not a weapon. Not a tool. But a **mind behind the system**.

Where **WOLverine** awakens machines with the ferocity of Logan, **ControlX** manages them with the clarity and precision of Xavier. It listens. It thinks. It acts—remotely, securely, and intelligently.

With ControlX, you don’t just control systems.  
You **orchestrate** them.

## 🧪 Usage Examples

### Run a Remote Command

Assuming you’ve defined an API endpoint like:

```json
POST /api/code
{
  "path": "/home/user/project"
}
```

You can trigger it with:

```bash
curl -u admin:controlx \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{"path": "/home/user/project"}' \
  http://localhost:5000/api/code
```

### Import/Export API Definitions

Export:

```bash
curl -O http://localhost:5000/export_csv
```

Import:

Upload via web UI or:

```bash
curl -u admin:controlx -F "file=@your_endpoints.csv" http://localhost:5000/import_csv
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

* If using GUI commands (e.g. `firefox`, `code`), ensure:

  * Your app runs **outside Docker**, or
  * You implement a **host-side execution agent**
  * The `DISPLAY` environment is set and accessible

* ControlX is meant to be **minimal**, **secure**, and **extendable**.

## 🧠 Why “ControlX”?

> “The greatest power on Earth is the magnificent mind of a free man.”
> — *Professor X*

Just as Charles Xavier connects, manages, and empowers mutant minds, ControlX serves as the **central intelligence** of your digital infrastructure. With **precision, foresight, and security**, it turns shell commands into RESTful actions—bridging the gap between terminal and network, brain and system.

**WOLverine wakes machines. ControlX commands them.**
